# super_izhikevich
 A python exercise in class inheritance with Izhikevich cells

## Exercise: Create more Izhikevich Cell Types
Referring to the equations for Izhikevich cells (see below), create new cell types for intrinsically bursting and chattering cells.

Create each cell type as a child of the izhCell cell type (definition available in izhikevich_cells.py). Override any properties (or methods) as necessary.
